In this example the two components of a long duration record with low frequency 
content are self-matched to their RotD100 response spectrum for verification 
purposes after an issue reported by https://github.com/longchen-geo. 

As a result, the code was modified to make the decomposition frequency range 
dependent on the record duration.
